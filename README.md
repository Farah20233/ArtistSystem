# ArtistSystem

Artist Assistant application and the system are developed to assist artists with the 
hassle of sharing their artwork to the public and the business side of it. Sharing and selling 
artwork is a very time-consuming process and considering that artists are already focused on 
making the artwork itself, the processes of sharing and selling artwork will hardly fit in their 
schedule. This app and system will assist artists by providing a platform that can organize and 
manage various artistsâ€™ issues such as subscriptions, presentation of their artworks, a search 
engine for customers, order, and demands features as well as payment and shipping 
processes. This way artists can share their artwork online in a modern and efficient way
